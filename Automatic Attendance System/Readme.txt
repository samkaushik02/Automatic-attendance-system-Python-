Enter your gmail and password in the line 66 and 103 to make the email system workable also go to settings of your gmail settings and allow  "Sign in from less secure devices"
For face detector screen either use line 68-69 which will give full screen detector or 74-75 which will give 500x500 detector. You can use 'ecs' button to close detector.
